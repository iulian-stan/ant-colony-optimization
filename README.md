# Ant Colony Optimization

The purpose of this project is to show the use of **ACO** (Ant Colony Optimization) methods in minimization problems. ACO is applied on problems that can be reduced to finding paths through graphs, so this implementation targets directly one of the well known cases - **Traveling Salesman Problem**. Since **ACO** may not find the optimal solution, alongside it there is a backtrack algorithm implementation for comparison.

Another swarm intelligence based algorithm can be found here - [Particle Swarm Optimization](https://github.com/Iulian-Stan/particle-swarm-optimization).

## Solution
By running the application it can be seen that the system places the ants in different cities (points), each one trying to find a path. Combining the solutions, the application iteratively produces the best one (**!** it does not mean that the solution is optimal).

## Interface

**ACO** solution

**Backtrack** solution

There is a graphical representation of the problem on the left side and control panel on the right.

## Graphic
Dots represent cities (green one - the starting city, red - others) and arrows the best found path. As mentioned before **ACO** can find a local best, not necessarily the global one.

## Control
Parameters:
* **Cities** - the number of cities
* **Ants** - ant colony population
* **Delay** - small freeze time amount used in simulation
* **Iterations** - number of iteration the algorithm is run
* **α** - **pheromone** influence factor (how much the chosen path is influenced by pheromones)
* **β** - individual influence factor (how much individual desired affect the chosen path)
* **ρ** - **pheromone** evaporation coefficient

Best found solution and optimal solution in terms of path cost (length) are displayed on the bottom.
